# NFT Implementation on Algorand

This document outlines the comprehensive NFT creation, minting, trading, and swapping system implemented for event tickets using the Algorand blockchain.

## Overview

The system leverages Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs) to create unique, verifiable NFT tickets for events, concerts, movies, hotels, and resorts. It includes atomic swaps for peer-to-peer trading and QR code verification for event entry.

## Key Features

### 1. NFT Creation and Minting
- **Algorand Standard Assets (ASA)**: NFTs are created as ASAs on Algorand
- **Low Fees**: Minting costs are typically a fraction of a cent
- **Fast Confirmation**: Near-instant confirmation due to Algorand's Pure Proof-of-Stake consensus
- **Metadata Support**: Rich metadata including event details, seat information, and pricing

### 2. NFT Trading and Marketplace
- **Opt-in Mechanism**: Users must opt-in to receive assets (spam protection)
- **Instant Transfers**: NFTs can be transferred between wallets instantly
- **Royalty Support**: Automatic royalty distribution on resales
- **Atomic Transfers**: Secure, all-or-nothing transactions

### 3. Atomic Swaps
- **Trustless Trading**: Peer-to-peer NFT swaps without intermediaries
- **Atomic Execution**: Both parties must sign for the swap to complete
- **Expiry Support**: Time-limited swaps with automatic cancellation
- **On-chain Security**: All swaps are recorded immutably on the blockchain

### 4. QR Code Verification
- **Event Entry**: QR codes for quick ticket verification at venues
- **Blockchain Verification**: Real-time verification of ticket authenticity
- **Metadata Display**: Show ticket details during verification

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **AlgorandNFTService** (`lib/algorand/nft-service.ts`)
   - Handles all Algorand blockchain interactions
   - Manages ASA creation, minting, and transfers
   - Implements atomic swap functionality
   - Provides QR code generation and verification

2. **API Routes**
   - `/api/nft/create` - Create NFT collections for events
   - `/api/nft/mint` - Mint individual tickets
   - `/api/nft/swap` - Create and execute atomic swaps
   - `/api/nft/verify` - Verify ticket authenticity

3. **UI Components**
   - `NFTLifecycleTimeline` - Track ticket from purchase to event entry
   - `AtomicSwapModal` - Interface for creating atomic swaps
   - `QRVerification` - QR code generation and verification interface

4. **Dashboard Pages**
   - Merchant NFT Management (`/dashboard/merchant/nft-management`)
   - User NFT Collection (`/dashboard/user/nfts`)

## Implementation Details

### NFT Creation Process

1. **Event Setup**: Merchant creates an event with ticket details
2. **NFT Collection Creation**: System creates an ASA with event metadata
3. **Minting**: Individual tickets are minted as users purchase them
4. **Distribution**: NFTs are sent to user wallets after payment

### Metadata Structure

```typescript
interface NFTMetadata {
  name: string
  description: string
  image: string
  attributes: Array<{
    trait_type: string
    value: string | number
  }>
  event_id: string
  event_title: string
  event_date: string
  event_location: string
  seat_number?: string
  section?: string
  ticket_type: 'general' | 'vip' | 'backstage' | 'reserved'
  price: number
  currency: 'ALGO' | 'USDC'
}
```

### Atomic Swap Process

1. **Swap Creation**: User creates a swap proposal with another user's asset
2. **Counterparty Agreement**: Both parties must agree to the swap terms
3. **Atomic Execution**: Transaction executes only if both parties sign
4. **Asset Exchange**: Assets are exchanged simultaneously and securely

### QR Code Verification

1. **QR Generation**: System generates QR codes with ticket metadata
2. **Scanning**: Event staff scan QR codes at entry points
3. **Blockchain Verification**: System verifies ticket ownership and validity
4. **Entry Decision**: Valid tickets grant entry, invalid ones are rejected

## Security Features

### Blockchain Security
- **Immutable Records**: All transactions are permanently recorded
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Digital signatures ensure authenticity
- **No Double Spending**: Blockchain prevents ticket duplication
- **Transparent History**: Complete transaction history is publicly verifiable

### Smart Contract Logic
- **Atomic Transfers**: All-or-nothing transaction execution
- **Royalty Enforcement**: Automatic royalty distribution on resales
- **Transfer Restrictions**: Optional restrictions on ticket transfers
- **Expiry Management**: Time-based validity checks

## Usage Examples

### Creating an NFT Collection

```typescript
const nftParams = {
  metadata: {
    name: "Concert Ticket",
    description: "VIP ticket for amazing concert",
    event_title: "Summer Music Festival 2024",
    event_date: "2024-07-15T20:00:00Z",
    event_location: "Madison Square Garden, NYC",
    ticket_type: "VIP",
    price: 150,
    currency: "ALGO"
  },
  totalSupply: 1000,
  unitName: "CONCERT",
  assetName: "Concert Ticket",
  royaltyPercentage: 2.5
}

const result = await AlgorandNFTService.createNFT(nftParams, privateKey)
```

### Creating an Atomic Swap

```typescript
const swapParams = {
  assetId1: 12345,
  assetId2: 67890,
  fromAddress1: "user1_address",
  fromAddress2: "user2_address",
  amount1: 1,
  amount2: 1,
  expiryTime: Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // 24 hours
}

const swap = await AlgorandNFTService.createAtomicSwap(swapParams)
```

### Verifying a Ticket

```typescript
const verification = await AlgorandNFTService.verifyNFTTicket(
  assetId,
  walletAddress,
  eventId
)
```
